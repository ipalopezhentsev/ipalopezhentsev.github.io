Welcome to my blog! My name is Ilya Palopezhentsev and I am a software developer in the Moscow office of [Deutsche Bank](http://db.com). I work on automating FX market risk management.

### My interests are:
* Java
* Kotlin
* Server side development
* Modern programming techniques & libraries. 
* Performance optimization
* Automated tests

I will be using this blog for sharing interesting stuff I've come across, as long as it fits categories above.


One of my hobbies is photography, I write about it at [separate blog](https://ipalopezhentsev.github.io/photo)


Thanks for reading!
