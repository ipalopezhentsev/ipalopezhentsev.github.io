Hello! Please see [About](/about) for information on me. I used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) to create this blog.
Also [this page](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) was very helpful for initial setup of Jekyll.

Last but not least, I got inspired to create the blog after reading [this article](http://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2014/08/01/why-blogging.html).
